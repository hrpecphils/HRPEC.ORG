      </h1>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-sm pb-2 tablet:pb-2 desktop:text-xl desktop:pb-4">July 18, 2023</h3>
      <p class="font-merriweather text-xs desktop:text-xl">The Human Rights and People Empowerment Center welcomes the
        International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to proceed
        with its investigation into the killings under former president Rodrigo Duterte’s “War on Drugs”. At the very
        least,
        the ICC’s effort is a step forward from the years of deliberate inaction and silencing by the Duterte
        administration.
        At best, it would offer reprieve for the victims of a senseless bloodbath—those who deserve justice the most. This
        is
        a win for all Filipinos.
        <br>
        <br>
        We appeal to Sec. Boying Remulla and the Department of Justice: NO MORE DELAYS and offer full cooperation with the
        ICC. Let justice prevail and may our shared humanity with the aggrieved take the fore
        <br>
        <br>
        IF THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE "DRUG WAR", LET THE ICC INVESTIGATE.
        The Human Rights and People Empowerment Center (HRPEC) welcomes the International Criminal Court’s (ICC)
        resumption of its investigation on former president Rodrigo Duterte’s “War on Drugs.” This gives the families of
        the victims renewed hope in seeking justice. This is a victory for the researchers, human rights advocates, and
        people from various sectors who have kept the fire of hope burning. We salute the victims and witnesses who
        continue to risk their safeties and conveniences to stand up for truth and justice.
        The Philippine government should take a more positive stance and view the resumption of the ICC probe as a
        challenge for it to produce more significant results in its own probe. This will not thwart the process of
        investigating on the thousands killed, but especially investigating those most responsible for this murderous
        policy. Efforts must be serious, resolute, and should result in successful prosecutions and time served for the
        perpetrators. Lest it be forgotten, too—there are Filipinos with firm convictions, ready to cooperate with the
        ICC’s investigation.
        <br>
        <br>
        While some cases have progressed to the trial level, killings continue to be reported under the new
        administration. Dahas PH notes that there have been 187 drug-related killings since Marcos Jr. took his oath as
        President. We are also aware that while the “War on Drugs” persists, the questions on its constitutionality have
        yet to be fully addressed by the Supreme Court.
        <br>
        <br>
        We urge the Department of Justice and the Solicitor General's Office to fully cooperate with the ICC if it is
        sincere in its promise to deliver "real justice in real time". Lost lives in the name of the “War on Drugs”
        matter. In continuing anti-drug operations, lives must be protected. More lives will be lost when the truth is
        obscured, and people are made to believe the lie that the government needed to kill to cleanse ourselves of the
        drug menace.

          ICC. Let justice prevail and may our shared humanity with the aggrieved take the fore
          <br>
          <br>
          IF THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE "DRUG WAR", LET THE ICC INVESTIGATE.
          The Human Rights and People Empowerment Center (HRPEC) welcomes the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) resumption of its investigation on former president Rodrigo Duterte’s “War on Drugs.” This gives the families of the victims renewed hope in seeking justice. This is a victory for the researchers, human rights advocates, and people from various sectors who have kept the fire of hope burning. We salute the victims and witnesses who continue to risk their safeties and conveniences to stand up for truth and justice.
          The Philippine government should take a more positive stance and view the resumption of the ICC probe as a challenge for it to produce more significant results in its own probe. This will not thwart the process of investigating on the thousands killed, but especially investigating those most responsible for this murderous policy. Efforts must be serious, resolute, and should result in successful prosecutions and time served for the perpetrators. Lest it be forgotten, too—there are Filipinos with firm convictions, ready to cooperate with the ICC’s investigation.
          <br>
          <br>
          While some cases have progressed to the trial level, killings continue to be reported under the new administration.  Dahas PH notes that there have been 187 drug-related killings since Marcos Jr. took his oath as President.  We are also aware that while the “War on Drugs” persists, the questions on its constitutionality have yet to be fully addressed by the Supreme Court.  
          <br>
          <br>
          We urge the Department of Justice and the Solicitor General's Office to fully cooperate with the ICC if it is sincere in its promise to deliver "real justice in real time".  Lost lives in the name of the “War on Drugs” matter. In continuing anti-drug operations, lives must be protected.  More lives will be lost when the truth is obscured, and people are made to believe the lie that the government needed to kill to cleanse ourselves of the drug menace.

    <p class="font-merriweather text-xs desktop:text-xl"> The Human Rights and People Empowerment Center (HRPEC) views
      with grave concern the move of the Anti-Terrorism Council
      (ATC) to designate Dr. Natividad Castro as a “terrorist” as it noted that the while the council has accused her of
      violation of certain provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act (R.A. 11479), it has not made public any of the evidence
      or
      information that it claims to have against the community physician. <br><br>

      Thus far, the only information available is the assertion made by National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA)
      Dir. Gen. Ricardo De Leon (ATC Secretariat head) during an interview on ANC that Dr. Castro violated certain
      provisions of R.A. 11479. Dir. Gen. De Leon specifically cited section 6 (Planning, Training, Preparing and
      Facilitating the Commission of Terrorism), section 10 (Recruitment to and Membership in a Terrorist Organization)
      and
      Section 12 (Providing Material Support to Terrorists). However, when pressed for details, he merely claimed that
      the
      ATC is in possession of affidavits of at least five witnesses who purportedly have “personal knowledge” regarding
      the
      activities of Dr. Castro and that the same were also sufficient for the Anti-Money Laundering Council to freeze
      her
      assets. <br><br>

      It also does not make sense that when asked why the ATC has not filed criminal charges against Dr. Castro if it
      has
      strong evidence against her, Dir. Gen. De Leon’s reply was the decision to designate her as a “terrorist” was a
      “preventive” move. Whether or not it was a “preventive” action (perhaps he meant “preemptive”), the logical step
      for
      ATC would have been to file charges. This seems to belie its claim that there is indeed strong evidence against
      Dr.
      Castro. <br><br>

      What seems clear is that Dr. Castro’s constitutional rights may have been violated, and her designation as a
      “terrorist” has placed her life in imminent danger. <br>

      <p class="font-merriweather text-xs desktop:text-xl">The Human Rights and People Empowerment Center (HRPEC) is
        calling on Chief PNP Police Gen. Rodolfo Azurin, Jr. to
        direct the PNP Internal Affairs Service (IAS) to immediately deploy a team from its central headquarters in Camp
        Crame
        to conduct an in-depth investigation into the abduction of development workers Dyan Gumanao and Armand Gayoha last
        January 10 at the Port of Cebu. Gumanao is an organizer of Community Pantry PH (which is affiliated with HRPEC) in
        Cebu while Gayoha is a volunteer worker for the Alliance of Health Workers-Cebu. Gumanao’s father said they
        surfaced
        yesterday (January 16) after officials of UP Cebu negotiated (with their captors) for their release. <br><br>
  
        The Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7) should also be ordered to immediately stop its own probe

        the incident and just turn over its findings to the PNP IAS given the possibility that police officers assigned to
        PRO-7 were directly involved in the abduction. Among the indicators are the following: 1) Dyan reportedly told her
        father after their release that the men who took them claimed to be police officers; 2) both Dyan and Armand had
        been
        subjected to harassment, including red-tagging, after her arrest in 2020 for breaking Covid 19 health protocols;
        3)
        the video that surfaced showing the abduction was carried out with such impunity, in broad daylight and in full
        view
        of a crowd, including several security personnel of the port authority; and, 4) the seeming lack of interest and
        inaction on the part of the two police stations as well as the maritime police station where the parents and
        colleagues of Dyan and Armand reported the abduction and sought help.
        <br><br>
        
        HRPEC is also urging the Department of Justice to conduct a parallel probe, through the NBI, to gather all material
        facts preparatory to criminal prosecution. This is a chance for the Marcos administration to show its commitment to
        the Rule of Law.

      The Human Rights and People Empowerment Center (HRPEC) is calling on Chief PNP Police Gen. Rodolfo Azurin, Jr. to
      direct the PNP Internal Affairs Service (IAS) to immediately deploy a team from its central headquarters in Camp
      Crame
      to conduct an in-depth investigation into the abduction of development workers Dyan Gumanao and Armand Gayoha last
      January 10 at the Port of Cebu. Gumanao is an organizer of Community Pantry PH (which is affiliated with HRPEC) in
      Cebu while Gayoha is a volunteer worker for the Alliance of Health Workers-Cebu. Gumanao’s father said they
      surfaced
      yesterday (January 16) after officials of UP Cebu negotiated (with their captors) for their release. <br><br>

      The Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7) should also be ordered to immediately stop its own probe
      into
      the incident and just turn over its findings to the PNP IAS given the possibility that police officers assigned to
      PRO-7 were directly involved in the abduction. Among the indicators are the following: 1) Dyan reportedly told her
      father after their release that the men who took them claimed to be police officers; 2) both Dyan and Armand had
      been
      subjected to harassment, including red-tagging, after her arrest in 2020 for breaking Covid 19 health protocols;
